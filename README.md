# Overview

With this project, my main goal is to learn more about Java and its syntax as well as get more practice with classes and abstraction.
Overall, I want more practice with OOP.

The software I wrote here is a very simple banking program that allows you to select an account with an ID and make simple transactions.
You also have the ability to create a new account. This is the only functionality right now, although there are future improvements
I would like to make.

The reason I made this software was to have a simple program to start with as I'm learning Java. I wanted something easy to start with
so I could put my main focus on just getting practice with the language, but something I can expand and add onto; or possible continue
with to make a mobile app.

# Development Environment

I started by using the eclipse IDE, but eventually moved to VSCode for convenience since
I am more used to the layout and setting up repositories in it.

I used the Java programming language for this project, which is all about classes. It was interesting
to problem solve here because I don't have a lot of experience right now with designing programs based on 
just classes.

# Future Work

Some things I'd like to add to improve this program:
* Fix user input errors
* Connect to an external database to store account data
* Implement this program into a mobile app
